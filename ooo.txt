spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5Question and Answer
Michael Nathanson
And as a gift to us today at Spencer decide -- sign an NFL contract with, for the next 3 years, we just got that text a minute ago. So
thank you for doing that. Thank you for making news. What can you say to us about why this, why it makes sense? And anything you
could share?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure. First, good morning, everybody. Thank you, Michael, for having us. We appreciate the opportunity to chat with you all. Yes, big
day, exciting news for us today with our NFL deal, so it's very exciting.
I first want to give a quick shout out and congratulations to our Chief Content Officer, Bela and her team for getting this deal over the
goal line, no pun intended. I know it was a lot of hard work.
But I think of this as really more part of our strategy to build out a big log of entice the programming rather than a big move into
sports per se. And the step back here, Michael, is that about a year ago, we made a big jump into live, as most of you know, to tap into
all that consumer passion around comedy, reality television, sports entertainment and more.
And through that, we've learned that programming like the Chris Rock selective outrage special, most recently the roast with Tom
Brady, those types of programming can really deliver huge breakthrough moments that our audiences really love.
And we're going to continue to build on that strategy. Most -- or next up with Mike Tyson and Jake Paul fight in July, and then with
the WWE coming to Netflix in January of 2025. And I think that type of engagement is differentially important to both our members
and to our business, because in a world of audience fragmentation and so many entertainment choices, I think what's really rare are 3
things: attention; the ability to bring mass audiences together; and thirdly, really passionate viewing.
And I think the NFL really fits in well with that strategy. So again, I really think of this as an extension of that approach to build a big
log of entice the programming.
Michael Nathanson
Okay. And anything about the press reports about the cost of it is room in the journal, I think $75 million. It doesn't seem like this is a
big risk in terms of what Netflix has to pay to be in this business?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Yes, that's right. So I can't confirm the specific details of it, but I would say it's a very manageable cost. I would characterize each
game as roughly the size of one of our medium-sized original films. It fits within our existing content budget of about $17 billion in
cash spend this year, so no impact on our operating margin guidance for this year.
Robert Fishman
Okay. So we're going to ask you to put your old analyst hat back on.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Scary. I'm not sure I was very good at it.
Robert Fishman
Well, let's speak about that. So in terms of the cord cutting that we're seeing today, right, I think you were well ahead of where you
thought this was going to go and where we are today. So given that you've had this front row seat to the disruption that we've all been
seeing in the media ecosystem, since joining Netflix almost 10 years ago now, I think, but 9 years.

Robert Fishman
So maybe what has been the biggest surprise to you over this period and maybe even bringing in, obviously, sports as part of that, how
that has the potential to even disrupt further the traditional consistent.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure. It's a good question, Robert. I would say the reflection, I don't think is super insightful. I would say I was -- as an analyst, I was
pretty convinced that this is the direction that things were headed in.
I think if I reflect, I'm probably surprised by how slowly it's gone actually in a way. So I think the -- you know the numbers here,
Michael and Robert, but I think there's still 70 million households in the U.S. that pay roughly $100 for pay-TV. So -- and that's with
all the great stuff onstreaming, the added convenience of on-demand and things of that nature.
So if anything, winter TV has actually been, I think, pretty sticky relative to my expectations. And that transition in other countries is
also pretty measured. So in a way that just gives us a continued long runway as the world undergoes.
Robert Fishman
The irony is that what has accelerated it, is the pivot to stream. Basically, they followed you in a very economical way to try to
become Netflix and they've killed the golden goose more quickly in recent years.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Well, I'm not sure that's totally fair. I think to their credit, they see the trends, too. And I think they're trying to adjust the best they
can, and they have to manage a business just like we had to manage a legacy business, which is DVD for us. So we all took different
approaches. And I don't behoove them the way they are.
Robert Fishman
Okay. So on that point, it feels like the capital intensity, which drove that surge in content production, pay-TV.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Yes.
Michael Nathanson
It feels like it's slowed dramatically. So what are you seeing with regards to competitive landscape? And how do you think the
meltdown across media is impacting your ability to grab more consumer engagement and attention?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure. I'd say, relative to 3 to 4 years ago, there are more licensing opportunities from other CEOs for sure. But I wouldn't say it's a
big game changer for us. We've always had a lot of variety, a lot of quality in the catalog. Originals are our present and our future and
second-run content is an important ingredient for our offering, but it's not the majority of it.
And I would say the business continues to be really competitive. And we don't take that for granted. We don't take our positioning for
granted. We are very respectful of the competitors, the entertainment companies all -- are have their own unique strength. They have
really big content libraries. They have established IP and franchises; they have a proven track record of creating great television and
film. So they're still really good at that.
And obviously, our technology peers like the Amazon and Apple and YouTube are still investing very heavily. So I'd say the
competitive landscape is still really intense, but I would say, honestly, Michael, we don't spend too much time obsessing about it
because there's frankly not much we can do about what they're doing. The only thing we can really do is focus on what we deliver for
members. That's why you constantly hear us talk about trying to improve all aspects of our service because that's what we learned is
really the winning ingredient rather than over-obsessing on what other folks are doing.NETFLIX, INC. COMPANY CONFERENCE PRESENTATION  MAY 15, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7Robert Fishman
So on that point, in the last shareholder letter, you talked about to sustain the healthy long-term growth. Netflix has to continue to
improve and grow, I guess, the variety and quality of the entertainment offering that you're offering subscribers and potential new
subscribers. So can you maybe help us think about different genres as you think about from a company perspective, where you're
focusing on improving maybe outside of live events, which is the obvious one today? And maybe how does that translate into overall
growth on content spending?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure. So as I've mentioned, Robert, we're -- we focus on bringing everything at Netflix, and that includes finance, includes marketing,
includes content, the product discovery experience, we're pretty religious about constant improvement.
So focusing specifically on content. I think if Bela was here, she'd say, he's focused on maximizing every dollar she spends on content
and the impact that comes from it across core entire portfolio, whether that scripted series or unscripted or original film. We have a
new leader and Dan Lin, who's going to make his mark on that content category as well.
So honestly, we see lots of opportunity to improve across all aspects of it. And then we have newer areas like live and games, which
we're still at just very early stages on. So again, it's really exciting in a way because we are trying lots of different things, and we still
have a lot of opportunity in the core business, also we just get better.
In terms of the content spend also, I don't want to cover that question. So I would say we want to continue to march up our content
spend steadily over time, maximizing the impact of each dollar, but we also manage it within the context of our overall margin goals,
which is about a 25% margin this year on an FX-neutral basis and then improvement annually from here.
Michael Nathanson
Going to the idea of live events, it's been a year or so, big fights coming. What have you learned over the year live events, so what are
the key learnings? And what's approved to you in terms of what you guys had assumed going into it?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Yes. We learned a lot. So a lot of it is operationally how to do these well at scale. So I think we're putting a lot of attention and focus
on that. We're getting better and better at that, more and more seamless at that, hopefully. On the programming side, as I mentioned
with Chris Rock like [indiscernible] or the Tom Brady Roast, Netflix Slam, I just think we have realized that eventize programming
can have an outsized it back, and then not all hours of viewing are created equalness.
So I think, again, if you can tie in those things I talked about earlier and create big moments that really matter to consumers and that
are very pervasive throughout the society or that group -- that audience cohort, it can be really impactful. And there is that not all
hours are created equal. And I think we're going to have more and more powerful moments.
Robert Fishman
And one of the things we always heard was an impediment to getting sports rights as the ability to produce them. We've heard from
incumbents, look, it's hard to do what we're doing. You guys be able to produce -- how are you going to produce the NFL game or
how do you think about that?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Yes. So we're working through the details on that side, say TBD right now, but we have a rough plan in place, but probably not too
early to get into the sales of it. But I'd say that's part of our learning process, right?
So working on things like Netflix Slam or the golf tournament in Las Vegas, Yes, not easy. A lot of work that goes into it, but we're
building that muscle. And if anything, the one thing I think Netflix is good at is as Reed has said in the past is that we're a learning
machine, and we struck learning as quickly.
Michael NathansonNETFLIX, INC. COMPANY CONFERENCE PRESENTATION  MAY 15, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8Maybe the natural follow-up to that is, as you mentioned earlier, WWE. So as we think about that coming aboard 2025, how do we
think about the possible expansion of how impactful that's going to be to learning process in terms of production capabilities and also
just bigger picture live and the potential IP that actually comes from IP.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Yes, super excited to be in business with WWE very anxious to get to 2025 when we can offer this to our members. And I think it's
great from many different angles for us. So they have a very established band base, not just in the U.S., but in -- across the world in
big markets for us like India as a example, strong following there. It gives us a regular cadence also a live programming, which I think
will also help us hone our skills in terms of being able to deliver that type of programming for our audience.
And I think with our reach, with our engagement, we hope that we can also grow the popularity of WWE for them. So I think it's
going to be really exciting. And it's -- we haven't had this type of programming on Netflix. So there's a lot we don't know about it just
yet, but we're excited to learn what it means to our members.
Robert Fishman
Yes. The international angle is a really interesting angle too.
Michael Nathanson
Yes. So as we now have 5 years of the streaming wars to observe, perhaps we -- maybe this is me, have underappreciated the massive
technology advantage you have in content discovery, recommendations, ease of use, efficiency of the network. Are those advantages
that others will find in time? Or do you think taking about Netflix' culture and the learning machine that you are that those advantages
have come because of the way your company was built and founded and your ethos.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
So I think it's 2 separate things. So I think we probably have some medium-term process or technology advantage, but we fully expect
our competitors, they're all profess -- they're all pros, so to learn these things in the fullness of time, too.
So I think that's -- we would expect that. What I do think is a durable advantage for us, though, is this interesting combination of
things that are very interconnected. What I mean by that is number one, our reach, so to 270 million paid members, programming for
over 0.5 billion people across the world. Number two, a large content library with a lot of variety and quality of titles, married with a
discovery and product experience that can best match the right story with members at the right time.
And then on top of that, a great marketing team that can then sort of fuel the fandom and the passion around each of these moments.
And I think when you take all those together, that's what enables things like chest sales to skyrocket after Queen's Gambit or for the F1
to grow in popularity from Drive to Survive or for 3 Body Problem book sales that go up the charts when we release that series.
And I said, largely mostly only -- you hear about what happening with Netflix and the business process, I think, as Doug did the
Netflix effect or something like that. And I think admittedly, it's hard to quantify. So you can't put in your spreadsheet, but I do think
that is something that is quite special and very hard to replicate. And that's taken many, many years of us iterating constantly to the
learning point to get this in a position that we can sort of do this, and we want to be able to do it on a more recurring basis more and
more.
Robert Fishman
Right. So over the past couple of years, you've clearly rolled out 2 major revenue initiatives...
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Yes.
Robert Fishman
As you think about the longer-term growth, curious over that shorter period of time. Any big surprises that have occurred, one that
comes to mind is the reaction that happened in Canada? And how you've learned from some of the surprises?NETFLIX, INC. COMPANY CONFERENCE PRESENTATION  MAY 15, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Yes. So I think on reflection, paid sharing has gone really well. And I have to tip my hat off to our Chief Product Officer, Eunice Kim
and her team and all the employees at Netflix has worked really hard on this initiative, which is, I think, gone very smoothly. I think
they were able to do it in a very elegant manner that was as minimally disruptive to our customers and to our business as possible.
And it wasn't easy. There's a lot of work. So I would say, I think that that's an example of the excellence we strive for as a company.
It's not always perfect like that, but I think it's an example of what we really hope to accomplish when we really focus and focus on
excellence.
And then on advertising, for me, it's still really early, but it's mostly a reminder that building new businesses from scratch it just takes
time. And so we're all impatient and we all want things that happen much faster, but that's just a natural rhythm of starting from 0,
quite honestly, in the case of ads. And so really for me, just a reminder, we just had continued grind and we got to continue to iterate
and improve every day.
Michael Nathanson
Robert's Canadian, by the way. So he was watching the Canadian experiment with Netflix and people...
Unknown Attendee
[indiscernible] into your...
Robert Fishman
Well, I'm not living there anymore, but a lot of family members...
Michael Nathanson
Family in market research.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
And Canadians never get angry, but they were getting angry when you guys went to the password-sharing and we're like, wow, and
then you pivoted and did very differently here.
Michael Nathanson
Yes, that's right. Can you -- let's talk a bit more about the ad products? You said on your last earnings at 40% of all sign-ups in your
ad markets are taking the ads here. Is there any significant dispersion by region? Or is that -- or is that dissimilar than the adoption? So
basically, give us a sense of the adoption by region, is anything very dissimilar?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
I would say it's very consistent by region by country, sort of plus or minus several percentage points around that 40%.
Michael Nathanson
Okay. And then how different is that adoption versus the low-end plans existed before, right? So back before this...
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Yes. Relative -- basic very similar.
Michael Nathanson
Okay. There's a way to drive net-net higher ARPU because it's really the long-term play on just higher ARPU net advertising.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor RelationsNETFLIX, INC. COMPANY CONFERENCE PRESENTATION  MAY 15, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10In general, yes. But obviously, as we mentioned on the last earnings call, we're still scaling our ads business, right? So there is still an
ARM headwind right now as we scale up our advertising business.
So we've been growing our ads membership base so quickly. So 65% membership growth quarter-on-quarter in Q1 on top of
70% growth in Q4. I thought the 70% growth in the quarter before that, on top of 100% growth. So there is naturally a lag in the
monetization of it as we grow our inventory and our supply. But that's a very fixable challenge for us. But I don't want to paint it all is
baby right now.
Michael Nathanson
But what are you seeing on the behavioral side of those subscribers?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Really solid engagement, I would say, probably better than our original expectations and consistent were comparable.
Michael Nathanson
Okay. Cool.
Robert Fishman
So switching over to the password sharing side. The initial communication was around this 100 million users that you were looking
to target $30 million in UCAN, so curious, as we're into it now, anything you can share in terms of the update and maybe frame the
percentage of how the conversion has gone relative to expectations, at least.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure. So I would say that you're right on the numbers, which is we did say about 100 million-plus households prior to the rollout of
paid sharing. We haven't been specific in terms of where we are in that conversion other than that it's going well and generally greater
than expectations. And really, it's not sort of a separate initiative these days. It's really just interwoven into our operations.
And so really, we think of it as just part of the business now. And just like all parts of the business, we'll continue to iterate on it and
improve it. And for you all, I think the takeaway is that there are 500 million connected TV households, excluding China and Russia.
We have about 270 million paid memberships today. And now that we have the sort of operational fix with paid sharing that allows
us to better penetrate that 500 million household TAM. Because without it, it would have been increasing hard for us to be able to do
that. So we're trying to orient folks on that opportunity as opposed to the very narrow sort of sharing pay [indiscernible]
Unknown Attendee
One of the great successes has been in Asia Pacific market, right? In Japan and South Korea, and a big source of growth. Same
time, there's a mix shift going on the ARPU line. Can you give us on the hood of what's happening broadly in Asia Pacific in such a
complicated market?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Yes. It is. And you're right, there are several factors, which, frankly, is one of the reasons we're moving away from some of that paid
membership in ARM line, which I'm sure you will ask us questions about on the call. But I would say a couple of factors. One, in
APAC, many markets haven't had a price change in a while a year plus. And we also have had several countries where about a year or
so ago, we actually lowered price. So that's been one factor.
Secondly, another factor is country mix. So if you looked at APAC 5, 6 years ago, it was practically almost all Australia. So that's a
higher income market and a higher price market. So the good news is we're growing quite quickly in other markets and countries like
India, but the Netflix is lower price there. So that drags down the average. We view that as actually a good thing, not a bad thing. So I
would say those are probably the most prevalent.
Michael Nathanson
Okay. It's a good segue, next question.NETFLIX, INC. COMPANY CONFERENCE PRESENTATION  MAY 15, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11Unknown Attendee
Yes. I mean we were going to ask you about India because there's been some recent developments in the market where Disney
has decided to partner with Reliance. So just maybe curious, as you think about the Indian opportunity, specifically, if you want to
comment about how that might impact it. But what do you see as like the future for India for Netflix?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure. So I can't speak much to the Reliance and Disney of it all. You probably have to ask them. But I would say India is an important
country for us. It is very competitive. But again, it's competitive everywhere. And in a way, it's good for the market in the sense that
consumers just have more and more choice and different options.
And our job is to just improve our offering. So it resonates with the Indian consumer, so we can grow faster there. So I would say we
don't have any sort of differential insight there in terms of what the competitors may or may not do. And we can't control it. So again,
we're just going to focus on what we do.
Unknown Attendee
I think there was comments this was going to be the next $100 million in terms of subscribers. So...
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
It may.
Unknown Attendee
Where are we on that path?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
I would say what I can tell you is that India is one of our fastest-growing countries. So I think we're on the right track there. But again,
it's still a lot of hard work. And by no means are we declaring victory. We know we still need to improve a lot there to get to that size
that you talked about or that we talked about.
Unknown Attendee
[indiscernible] So when you've been realistic as you are on the stage today about the near-term impact of the advertising opportunity,
it takes some time. What are the gating factors to scaling that business in the U.S. and international?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure. Let me first start by saying we're generally very optimistic about advertising in the ads business. So I want to make that
clear. And TV advertising is a very proven business. We're not reinventing the wheel here. So it's very -- it's been a core part of the
entertainment and the media business for a long time. And I think we're really well positioned because we have high-quality premium
programming. We have a big growing reach. We have very deep engagement on a per member household basis. So I think we have all
the right ingredients.
But you're right, it's not yet material for our business, partly because our subscription business is so big. So it's -- so that's one factor.
And secondly, we got to do 2 things: number one, grow our ad membership basis as mentioned earlier. And secondly, we need to
continue to develop our capabilities for advertising -- advertisers specifically measurement, verification, all those different factors. We
also have to improve our go-to-market sales approach as well. So lots of blocking and tackling, but all doable fullness.
Unknown Attendee
Yes. So one of our bigger surprises over the years is despite continued price increases at Netflix, but we usually see limited negative
reaction to that, which, again, speaks to how you guys continue to add value to the service and program appropriately. So curious if
you can kind of take us behind the scenes in terms of how you decide and when you decide to raise pricing, given all of that. Do you
factor in macroeconomic issues and like just really help us better understand the price raising strategy?NETFLIX, INC. COMPANY CONFERENCE PRESENTATION  MAY 15, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure. We think about all those things in general. So we have lots of big brains thinking about all those factors. So we look at on a
country-by-country basis, our current trends in retention and acquisition and engagement, we think about the competitive landscape.
We do think about macro factors like disposable income. Inflation, obviously, has been a big factor in parts of [indiscernible]. Well, so
we taking into all those -- taking into account all those factors, but I would say the primary factor is engagement for us because, again,
that is our best proxy or a sense of how much value we're delivering to our members.
And if we're growing that, that's a signal to us that we are delivering more value. And in general, we want to price a little bit behind
that value, so that consumers continue to think of us as a good value for them.
And then if we can adjust prices effectively, what we then want to do is reinvest a bunch of that back into the service, improve the
programming, to improve the discovery so we can continue to drive that virtuous cycle.
Michael Nathanson
Take it back to advertising for a second. This is upfront week. You guys have a presentation tomorrow. It's increasingly competitive
market because of YouTube and Amazon and there. So when you think about your chief differentiators. What's the go-to-market
messaging that you think differentiates you from other people who are chasing CTV and...
Robert Fishman
The way it till tomorrow, Michael.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
So I would say, in general, it's a lot of what I talked about earlier. I think we have great programming that advertisers want to be
adjacent to and a part of. I think they want to be part of the conversation around things like the Tom Brady roast or Wednesday or
Squid game. I think that's going to be really exciting. And that's our depth of engagement, I think, is also what really separates us from
the package, you can see from the Nielsen Gauge data.
Unknown Attendee
Yes. So as Craig Moffett, Front row right there. As you will tell you all too well that there's an upper bound in his industry's ability
take price and take price increases.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Professor Moffett [indiscernible] and pricing.
Unknown Attendee
He has [indiscernible] pricing. We have a case studies on that. But -- so to that point, can you talk about the arm lift that may be
available to you as your advertising initiatives roll out. So think about just the balance between driving ARM through advertising
versus any kind of upper band on pricing power?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
So I think when it comes to pricing, again, we really think of engagement as the best way to measure our ability to grow pricing. And
I think Craig is right, if you're not growing the value of your service, there's a limit to how much you can charge folks for to be honest.
But if you have a really valuable product that is really critical to people, then I think your customer base will pay for it.
So I think that's why we're focused on improving the engagement, improving the value to our members. And beyond that, I would
say advertising, I think, is a nice option. Because it does allow us to segment demand better because there are a range of incomes and
a range of needs amongst the population. And I think it's a great option for folks that don't want to necessarily pay that much in our
advertising tolerate. So that's sort of a little bit of the trade-off there. And so it's a nice sort of, I think, optimization of our pricing
right.NETFLIX, INC. COMPANY CONFERENCE PRESENTATION  MAY 15, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13Robert Fishman
So maybe taking that and again, like before all these recent initiatives have taken effect, the market was pretty comfortable assuming
long-term ARM growth in, call it, the mid-single-digit range. So as we think about these new initiatives and everything back to our
models, any way you can help us think about like the reasonable assumption going forward as we think about is going out?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
I'm not going to give guidance on ARM specifically. Again, we're trying to orient investors around the 3 variables that we focus on
engagement, revenue and profit. I would say we're on a good track this year. So we guided to about 13% to 15% revenue growth for
the year. We want to continue to sustain that healthy revenue growth beyond this year.
And we're not overly religious about how much of it comes from ARM versus, volume versus, advertising versus other factors. We
care about revenue growth, and we care about profitable revenue growth.
Unknown Attendee
So Spencer back when you're an analyst, you may have had a chart, which looks at the correlation on affiliate fees versus ratings. And
what you saw in that correlation that there was no correlation.
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Right.
Unknown Attendee
And so the question is, as you move into more live sports, is there a subtle hint that, look, we think this can drive higher ARM because
live may be worth more to people like us and just rerunning Friends or [indiscernible]?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Well, I'm not sure it's specifically live. I think it's impactful programming. So Squid Game for a lot of people is really impactable. And
for me, I really like beef as an example. So I think we need to have all those things for all 270-million-member households.
But to your point, not every hour of engagement is spread equal, which is why there is no correlation in that scatter plot that you
talked about. And so I do think the more that we're going to sort of break through moments like that, I think that's good for the
business.
So but really early days, but it doesn't have to be live. Again, when we have a great movie to like Barabbas, that's also really impactful
too. So again, I don't think it's just live, but I think live can be a big part of it.
Robert Fishman
So obviously, one of the big news items that came out of last quarter was just not specific to any business, but just in terms of
disclosure. So here we go. So in terms of the quarterly membership numbers, and clearly, we understand the focus on revenue. You
just hit on it, but curious what -- going back to analyst, Spencer, would say about this change. And just really how the investment
community should think about the evolution of the business given the disclosure?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure. Totally fair question. I think the analysts -- the former analyst in me would like it because it makes updating my model easier. 1
less variable, 2 less variables to worry about across 4 regions.
No, but in all seriousness, we're not trying to obfuscate anything, frankly. And we fully intend to grow subscribers, and we'll continue
to report subscribers as we pass certain milestones. So let me lead with that.
Beyond that, though, I think it's really a reflection of the evolution of our business. So we have added new revenue streams like
advertising like extra member, which isn't directly tied to a paid net add, as I mentioned earlier, we have increasingly segmented ourNETFLIX, INC. COMPANY CONFERENCE PRESENTATION  MAY 15, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14pricing, not just across countries, but even within countries, right? So the business impact of any one given net add can vary quite a bit
depending on what plan we're talking about in which country.
So for all those reasons, that traditional P times Q equation, I think it's just less insightful in terms of what's happening within the
business. I would say from a strict IR perspective, I personally feel that there's an overfocus on our quarterly pay net adds that
probably adds unnecessary volatility to the stock.
We're a subscription business primarily, which is recurring in nature, generally speaking. So we are very rarely off on revenue by
more than plus or minus 1%. But if you look at the stock trading, it's obviously much more volatile than that.
So I think this is a healthy evolution of the business. So we'll take it from there. But again, we're always evaluating what's most
helpful to the investment community in terms of external metrics. So we're open minded to that.
We did say we will provide more engagement data over time as well to add on to what I would consider industry-leading transparency
on engagement in terms of what we share today. So we'll continue to build on that for you all, and then we'll go from there.
Robert Fishman
Should we expect more disclosure or maybe just more milestone announcements in terms of what advertising revenue is contributing
or consumer products or even video games as you continue to build this out?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
That's a potentially natural progression, right? Obviously, they're all quite small today, but as they become hopefully more and more
material to the business. That would be in the natural evolution to the business. So I don't want to speculate us yet, but I think that's
certainly something we're contemplating to consider.
Unknown Attendee
It's about margins. The margin expansion in the past year has been extraordinary. How should we think about continued margin
expansion? I know Spencer talked about this back in the fall, but how do we on the outside dimension potential for the margin
expansion?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure. So I would say we I think done a good job proving that streaming at scale can be a good business and quite a profitable business.
And we're trying to balance long-term investment and sustain growth with also delivering improving profitability.
So again, we'll -- our target this year is to deliver about 4 percentage points of margin expansion. And beyond 2024, we talked about
growing our operating margin every year. It will probably vary a little bit. It won't be the sort of consistent 3 percentage point thing
that we had several years ago. But our intent is to gradually grow it and grow the business at the same time. So nothing more specific
at this point, but our intent is to grow the margins.
Robert Fishman
If I can follow-up on that, and again, given the news this morning, how do you think about the allocation of U.S. content spend versus
the global spend, right? So clearly, NFL is a specific item. But as we think about just the allocation of that and as you think about that
balance on margins, is it just always mostly from a global perspective? Or is there specific budgets by region?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
No. There are definitely specific budgets by region, by content vertical or category and our team, I think, in the content team does a
really nice job portfolio managing as an example. So I would say for us, it -- every piece of programming we've learned needs to be
most impactful in the home territory or home country.
And so the NFL is a good example of something that we expect to be very impactful in the U.S. And to the extent that it also takes off
in other countries, that sort of extra or gravy for both of us as well as the creator or in this case, the NFL.NETFLIX, INC. COMPANY CONFERENCE PRESENTATION  MAY 15, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15So that's how we sort of think about it. Again, we're trying to figure out each year what is the best way to allocate all that $17 billion
to be most impactful. And so it is really like a portfolio.
Michael Nathanson
Asking about another one of your jobs, which is corporate finance and looking at business development, can you discuss how Netflix
weighs potential M&A opportunities and maybe the buy versus build decisions in some new categories?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Sure. I think going back to my analyst days, and Michael, I don't know if you agree, I think you do, but M&A is hard. And the track
record of it is, I would characterize at least large-scale M&A pretty spotty.
So we're very cognizant of that and having lived through a couple of deals at Netflix, it is indeed hard. So I would say the way we
think about M&A is really as a tool for us to help advance our business and our strategy.
So the primary focus on any M&A opportunity is how does this help the business relative to similar sized opportunities and the
distraction tax. So we weigh those things together to just the idea if this is the best approach buy versus build.
We do all the other stuff that you sort of alluded to, the accretion dilution of it all, the ROI of it all. But as you know, I can make my
spreadsheet kind of say whatever I wanted to say, right? And really, it is about why are we doing this, again, relative to the other ways
to do it, this is the best path forward relative to the distraction tax and the money you're spending.
Unknown Attendee
Yes. But given the long-term focus about video games, curious how all of that plays into build versus buy on video games. Like is
there an opportunity to accelerate that with potential M&A?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Yes. So we've actually done a series of small game studio acquisitions in our first few years of games. And I would say we're feeling
our way along. So really early days for games. We've had some positive signals, Grand Theft Auto in Q4 as an example of a game that
well for us. But again, I would say too early to tell. And in terms of M&A, we'll always be open minded, but there's nothing sort of
imminent destiny.
Michael Nathanson
You're reaching the 9-year mark within Netflix, and I wondered if we had asked you when you started would it develop this way.
So this is a tough question, which is the next few years, 3 to 5 years out, how different will this company look? I'm not sure if you
would be able to predict it. If I ask you when you started, but when we see like all the pieces that are coming together, how is Netflix
changed 3 to 5-year?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
It's a really good question. I would say one of the things I've learned at Netflix and frankly, in life is changes being in constant and I
shall think change is a good thing. When I was younger, a change, it would be kind of scary or stressful, but I've actually certainly at
Netflix, learn to sort of embrace change.
I have a couple of colleagues here. I think the relates to the change, everything that happens. And in a way, it's kind of exciting and
thrilling because I think it's a signal, we're trying to be bold, entrepreneurial, which is true to our heritage and our culture, and we'll try
to move the business forward.
So I think -- the whole world is changing every day across every dimension. So of course, we have to change, right? And we were
static, that's probably not a good thing. So it's hard to predict where we're going to go. I would say, in general, our to North Stars as a
company are, number one, we want to please our members.
And secondly, we want to grow our profitability. Beyond that, most of the other things are pretty tactical, like getting into advertise or
getting into games or things like that. I think we strive to be the best entertainment company in the world, and to do great things as a
company and that's what we're sort of marching towards. And my guess is it will be pretty different because who would have predictedNETFLIX, INC. COMPANY CONFERENCE PRESENTATION  MAY 15, 2024
Copyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16where we are today. We're -- and we started as a DVD company, mailing discs in the mail Right? And now we're doing Christmas
Day NFL games, like that's kind of nuts if you think about it.
Michael Nathanson
So I guess someone that [indiscernible] said back 2 years ago, when you asked about advertising Morgan Stanley conference, never
say never. And I think what I've observed from you is never see never anymore. Like never say never, everything is an opportunity...
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
That's right.
Michael Nathanson
Because you can't just say, no, we'll never do this?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
That's right. And I think we've tried to sort of communicate that to you all, which is never say never in the sense like we're always
evaluating things. That's part of our job is to pay attention to what's going on in the world, and we need to adjust as circumstances
change. I think that's actually a healthy thing.
And so we're very open-minded to change. And honestly, that's why the culture is the way it is. If you go back to the original culture
deck from 2007, we talked about the ability to be adaptable because most companies are very good at this one thing that they do, but
business environments are never constant, right.
It may take 10 years, it may take 20 years, it may take 100 years, but things inevitably change. And we want to build a company that
can adapt to those changes and thrive regardless of the circumstances. So -- but again, we don't -- we also value focus, too.
So I know these things sound like they're in conflict or intention, but I think that intention is actually healthy, right? So we're always
trying to figure out, where do we need to sort of focus but also where do we need to adapt. And I think that was 1 of the great
learnings in 2022 when the business slowed down is that we do have to adapt as circumstances change.
Michael Nathanson
And there's having 2 CEOs with very different responsibilities and almost approaches to things, does that help in the ability to adapt
quickly?
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Look, I don't know if it helps in that dimension. I would say I think it's working really well, partially because I think there's a lot of
great trust between Ted and Greg, and they were together for so many years. So they're very familiar with each other. They obviously
both bring their own strengths to the table.
And so I think it's working well, but I think it goes beyond that Co-CEO structure. Again, as I talked about, the culture, again, if you
go back to our culture memo or culture deck, is really about excellence and how do we do that and building a culture that allows us
adaptable and very durable.
Robert Fishman
Maybe just last question, big picture for you. Anything that you want to leave for investors that...
Spencer Wang
Vice President of Finance, Corporate Development & Investor Relations
Well, I did get to say one thing about the NFL. How about the Cowboys. I always want to say that a lot audience [indiscernible] Sam,
as you can tell. But no, I would say, first of all, we thank you all for taking time out of your busy day to join us today. We thank our
shareholders for going with us on this journey to create, hopefully, a great entertainment company.NETFLIX, INC. COMPANY CONFERENCE PRESENTATION  MAY 15, 2024

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17And we're excited and optimistic about the business. But we also know we got a ton of hard work to do to more deeply penetrate that
$600 million TAM that we talked about. So again, we don't do these conferences too often because we're mostly just sort of heads
down focused on executing the best we can, and just I know that that's what we're doing and we're working hard.
And half of Netflix is here in New York City this week, I think, for the upfront because -- it's a really important initiative, and we're
eager to get that going here.
Michael Nathanson
Well, Spencer, thank you. behave Craig, Robert and I, we thank you talk for being here. We appreciate it.
